# Print All Subsequences

Problem statement
Given a string (lets say of length n), print all the subsequences of the given string.

Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to n. But the order of characters should remain same as in the input string.

Note :
The order of subsequences are not important. Print every subsequence in new line.

Sample Input:
abc

Sample Output:
""
c 
b 
bc 
a 
ac 
ab 
abc
