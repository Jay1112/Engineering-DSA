# Merge Sort

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]

## Time  Complexity : O(N*logN)
## Space Complexity : O(logN)[call-stack] + O(N)[new-array]
