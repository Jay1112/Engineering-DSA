## Subset Sum

Given a array arr of integers, return the sums of all subsets in the list.  Return the sums in any order.

Input: arr[] = [2, 3]
Output: [0, 2, 3, 5]

Explanation: When no elements are taken then Sum = 0. 
When only 2 is taken then Sum = 2. When only 3 is taken then Sum = 3. 
When elements 2 and 3 are taken then Sum = 2+3 = 5
